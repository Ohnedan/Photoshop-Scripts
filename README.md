### Document Info Extractor

**Description:**
This script for Adobe Photoshop extracts information about the document, including its dimensions, resolution, aspect ratio, and megapixel count. The gathered data is inserted into a new text layer in the center of the document.

**Script functionality:**
- Extract and display the document name.
- Determine the document dimensions in pixels, centimeters, and inches.
- Determine the document resolution in ppi and ppcm.
- Calculate and display the megapixel count.
- Determine the aspect ratio (both basic and Farey).
- Insert all gathered information as text into a new layer.

**Workflow:**
The script saves the current ruler units, switches to pixels for information extraction, and restores the original settings after execution.

### Stack in PSD

**Description:**
This Adobe Photoshop script serves several purposes:

- **Reverse Layer Order:** It rearranges the layers in a document so they appear in the opposite order of how they are currently stacked.
- **Save Document as PSD:** After rearranging the layers, the script saves the document as a PSD file on the computer's desktop.
- **Adjust Layer Visibility:** Following the save operation, the script ensures only the bottom layer remains visible while hiding all other layers.

**Function Descriptions:**
- `removeExtensions(layerName):` Strips file extensions (like `.tif`, `.jpg`, `.png`) from layer names.
- `reverseLayers(doc):` Flips the order of layers within the document.
- `savePSD(filePath):` Stores the current Photoshop file in PSD format at a specified location.
- `createPSDFolder():` Generates a "PSD" folder on the desktop if absent.

**Script Actions:**
- Removes file extensions from layer names.
- Reverses the order of layers.
- Establishes a "PSD" folder on the desktop if not present.
- Saves the document in PSD format, naming it based on the bottom layer.
